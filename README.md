LongPlay
========

Long Play is a record playing app that Adam Shutsa and Ash Furrow want to build in the open source community. It plays entire albums at once. The designers are located in the `Designs` folder.

Ash isn't the most experienced of OS X developers, and neither of us have the time to go "heads down" on this project, so we're hoping that this can be a fun experiment for us to see what it's like to development software in the open source community.

Ashn will be staying on top of the [Issues](https://github.com/AshFurrow/LongPlay/issues) section to manage the progress. If you want to help out, start there!
